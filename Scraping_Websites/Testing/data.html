    <p>This site only includes information about an attorney's public disciplinary history from January 1991 through February 2024, with one exception - this site does show whether an attorney was disbarred at any time prior to February 2024. If an attorney has been suspended or disbarred and subsequently reinstated or readmitted, this site could show the membership status of the attorney as "in Good Standing." If you have any questions or would like information about an attorney's public disciplinary history, please contact the Office of the General Counsel at 404-527-8720.<br>
    <br>
    Please check carefully to be sure that you have selected the correct attorney. Attorneys may have similar names.<br>
    <br>
    All grievances, investigations of grievances and private discipline are confidential. As such, the State Bar of Georgia is not able to confirm or deny that a grievance has been filed against an attorney, that an attorney is being investigated for an alleged violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, or that an attorney has received private discipline.<br>
    <br>
    Every effort has been made to keep the information contained on this website accurate and current, but it is provided with no warranty of any kind. Neither the State Bar of Georgia, nor its Officers, Executive Committee or Board of Governors, nor any employee thereof may be held responsible for the accuracy of the data.<br>
    <br>
    If you have any questions about the attorney's membership status, please contact the Membership Department at 404-527-8777.</p></div> </div> </div>  </div> </div> </div> </div>
