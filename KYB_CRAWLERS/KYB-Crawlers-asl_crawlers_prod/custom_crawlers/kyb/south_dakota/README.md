# Crawler: South Dakota

## Crawler Introduction
This Python script is a web scraper designed to extract information from the [South Dakota Secretary of State, Business Services Division](https://sosenterprise.sd.gov/BusinessServices/Business/FilingSearch.aspx). The script fetches data from the specified API endpoint, processes the retrieved HTML content, and inserts relevant information into a PostgreSQL table named "reports."

## Data Structure
The extracted data is structured into a dictionary containing various key-value pairs. The script defines functions such as `prepare_data` and `prapare_obj` to structure and prepare data for insertion into a database.
