        "text":"Installing runpodctl\nrunpodctl is an open-source command-line interface (CLI). You can use runpodctl to work with Pods and RunPod projects.\n\nWhen you create a Pod, it comes with runpodctl installed and configured with a Pod-scoped API key. You can also run runpodctl locally.\n\nTo install runpodctl on your local machine, run the appropriate command for your operating system.\n\nmacOS\nwget -qO- cli.runpod.net | sudo bash\nTIP\nIf you see an error similar to command not found: wget, make sure you have GNU wget installed.\n\nConfiguring runpodctl\nBefore you can use runpodctl, you must configure an API key. To create a new API key, complete the following steps:\n\nIn the web interface, go to your Settings.\nExpand API Keys and click the + API Key button.\nSelect Read or Read & Write permissions.\nClick Create.\nNOTE\nKeep your API key secret. Anyone with the key can gain full access to your account.\n\nNow that you've created an API key, run the following command to add it to runpodctl:\n\nrunpodctl config --apiKey your-api-key\nYou should see something similar to the following output:\n\nsaved apiKey into config file: \/Users\/runpod\/.runpod\/config.toml\nNow that you've configured an API key, check that runpodctl installed successfully. Run the following command:\n\nrunpodctl version\nYou should see which version is installed.\n\nrunpodctl v1.13.0\nIf at any point you need help with a command, you can use the --help flag to see documentation on the command you're running.\n\nrunpodctl --help"
